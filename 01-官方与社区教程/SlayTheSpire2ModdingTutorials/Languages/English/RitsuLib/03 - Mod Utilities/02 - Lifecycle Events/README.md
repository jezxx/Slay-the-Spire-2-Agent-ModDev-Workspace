`RitsuLib` provides a lifecycle event system, allowing you to listen to events at various stages such as game startup, a single run, and combat.

## Subscription Methods

Subscribe in `Entry.Init`. Choose your preferred subscription style.

### Method 1: Lambda Subscription

```csharp
using MegaCrit.Sts2.Core.Logging;
using MegaCrit.Sts2.Core.Modding;
using STS2RitsuLib;

namespace Test.Scripts;

[ModInitializer(nameof(Init))]
public class Entry
{
    public const string ModId = "Test";
    public static readonly Logger Logger = RitsuLibFramework.CreateLogger(ModId);

    public static void Init()
    {
        var sub = RitsuLibFramework.SubscribeLifecycle<GameReadyEvent>(evt =>
        {
            Logger.Info($"Game ready: {evt.Game}");
        });

        // To unsubscribe when no longer needed:
        // sub.Dispose();
    }
}
```

### Method 2: Interface Subscription

Implement `ILifecycleObserver` to handle multiple event types in a single class:

```csharp
using STS2RitsuLib;

namespace Test.Scripts;

public sealed class MyLifecycleObserver : ILifecycleObserver
{
    public void OnEvent(IFrameworkLifecycleEvent evt)
    {
        if (evt is CombatStartingEvent)
            Entry.Logger.Info("Combat is about to start");
        else if (evt is RunEndedEvent run)
            Entry.Logger.Info($"Run ended, victory={run.IsVictory}, abandoned={run.IsAbandoned}");
    }
}
```

Register in `Entry.Init`:

```csharp
RitsuLibFramework.SubscribeLifecycle(new MyLifecycleObserver());
```

## Common Events

* Below are common events categorized by game flow. Other events can be found by searching event names in the RitsuLib source code (typically in `*LifecycleContracts.cs` files under the `STS2RitsuLib` namespace).

* Each event carries an occurrence time `OccurredAtUtc`. If you subscribe after the event has already occurred, you will by default only receive new events thereafter.
* Set the second parameter `replayCurrentState` of `SubscribeLifecycle` to `true`, and some events will re-send the current state to you (e.g., subscribing to `GameReadyEvent` when the game is already ready will still immediately receive it once).
