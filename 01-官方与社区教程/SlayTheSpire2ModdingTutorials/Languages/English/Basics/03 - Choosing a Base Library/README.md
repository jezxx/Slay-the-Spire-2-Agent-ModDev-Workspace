> If you're making a character mod, using a base library cuts down on patches and workload. It also improves compatibility with other mods.

Two common base libraries right now: [BaseLib](https://github.com/Alchyr/BaseLib-StS2) and [RitsuLib](https://github.com/BAKAOLC/STS2-RitsuLib).

There is also a specialized minion library: [MinionLib](https://github.com/FuYnAloft/MinionLib).

See the respective sections for each.

## Important Notes

* Objectively speaking, for features that both libraries support, RitsuLib's implementation is generally more polished. Additionally, some features were contributed to BaseLib by the RitsuLib author.

* If you're not adding gameplay content, you don't need a base library. But for character mods and similar, using one saves work and improves compatibility.
