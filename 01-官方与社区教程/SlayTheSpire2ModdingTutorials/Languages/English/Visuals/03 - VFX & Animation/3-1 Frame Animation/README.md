## Frame Animation Sequences

Frame animation is the most basic VFX form: import multiple **transparent** PNG image sequences into Godot, compose them into an `AnimatedSprite2D` animation, and instantiate/play them in-game.

The advantage of frame animation is that it's common and simple — many downloadable and exported effects are in sequence frame format.
The downside is poor performance; you'll need to scale down and optimize. See the optimization section for details.

### 1. Import Sequence Images

Place PNG sequence images in your mod's resource directory, e.g.:

```
YourMod/images/effect_1/fn0001.png
YourMod/images/effect_1/fn0002.png
...
```

### 2. Create the Scene File (.tscn)

In the Godot editor, create a new scene with a `Node2D` root node and add an `AnimatedSprite2D` child node.

Try to create scenes manually through the Godot (Megadot) editor. AI-generated scenes can have various reference errors.

Select the AnimatedSprite2D node, then in the inspector panel on the right, create a new SpriteFrames.
![fx_frame_2.png](../../../images/fx_frame_2.webp)

Click on this SpriteFrames to open the animation sequence frame editor. Click "Add Frames from File" and import your sequence frames in order.

After import, you'll see the sequence frame chart below. Common buttons are labeled — adjust your effect as needed.

Example scene script reference (AI-generated):

```tscn
[gd_scene load_steps=5 format=3 uid="uid://5p6c4m60db7a"]

[ext_resource type="Texture2D" path="res://RegentFX/frames/guiding_star/fn0001.png" id="1_t3dcf"]
[ext_resource type="Texture2D" path="res://RegentFX/frames/guiding_star/fn0002.png" id="2_fuxtp"]

[sub_resource type="SpriteFrames" id="SpriteFrames_pwecx"]
animations = [{
"frames": [{
"duration": 1.0,
"texture": ExtResource("1_t3dcf")
}, {
"duration": 1.0,
"texture": ExtResource("2_fuxtp")
}],
"loop": true,
"name": &"default",
"speed": 5.0
}]

[node name="SampleEffect" type="Node2D"]

[node name="AnimatedSprite2D" type="AnimatedSprite2D" parent="."]
sprite_frames = SubResource("SpriteFrames_pwecx")

```

### 3. Attach a C# Script to Control the Animation

In the game, particle animations are usually played and destroyed via scripts. However, AnimatedSprite2D has auto-play, so if you don't need features like delayed playback, you don't need a playback script.

But you do need a destroy script. If your effect is a one-shot (e.g. a hit effect) rather than a looping permanent effect, it needs to auto-destroy after playback.

Attach a custom script to AnimatedSprite2D. If you don't want to add a script to every scene, you can also destroy effects via the VFXUtil custom method in Chapter 3-3.

```csharp
using Godot;

public partial class Effect : AnimatedSprite2D {
    public override void _Ready() {
    // Auto-delete after animation finishes
        AnimationFinished += QueueFree;
    }
}
```


### 4. Other Tips

- Sometimes your imported frame images are too large in resolution and cause noticeable stuttering in-game. You can scale them down via import settings.
  ![fx_frame_5.png](../../../images/fx_frame_5.webp)
  Batch-select your images. In the import settings at the top left, choose a lower resolution — e.g. if the original is 1080p, scale to 720/540.
